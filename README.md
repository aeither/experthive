## Problem it solves

High fees and commissions charged by intermediaries:

-	Traditional intermediaries such as banks or payment processors often charge high fees and commissions for their services, which can be a significant burden for entrepreneurs and experts.
-	By integrating blockchain technology, a consultancy platform can eliminate the need for intermediaries and reduce costs for users.
-	Transactions can be completed directly between entrepreneurs and experts, with the blockchain serving as a transparent and secure ledger to record the transactions.

Inefficient and slow payment processing methods:

-	Traditional payment processing methods can be slow and inefficient, leading to delays and frustration for users.
-	By integrating blockchain-based cryptocurrency wallets, a consultancy platform can enable fast and secure payment processing without the need for intermediaries.
-	Transactions can be completed in real-time, with low fees and without the need for lengthy processing times.

Limited control over personal data and information:

-	In traditional consultancy platforms, users often have limited control over their personal data and information, which can be vulnerable to data breaches and misuse.
-	By integrating decentralized storage and communication protocols, a consultancy platform can provide users with greater control over their data and information.
-	Users can store their data on a distributed network, where it is encrypted and can only be accessed by authorized parties. This increases security and privacy for users.
